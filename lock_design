When reading:
    when item read begins obtain a shared lock.

    when item read ends release the lock


When writing:
    Ensure that no shared locks exist
        if a shared lock does exist, create a file to signal reading processes to terminate after there current
        read is finished

    Obtain an exclusive lock stopping readers from making changes
    
    Need two layers of locks:
        a low level non-expiring lock which exists only while a single file is being changed.

        a broader reaching expiring lock existing over multiple write operations. This lock
        has to be time expiring and renewed by the client after every operation. We do not want
        a client which crashes or looses it's connection to permanently lock the server.

        if a client's write lock expires it has to obtain a new one
